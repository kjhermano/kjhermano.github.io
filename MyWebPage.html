			Hey there and Welcome to my first web page! My name is Kim John R.Hermano. I am a 20 year old male who lives in Brgy.Danhug, Ormoc City, Philippines. I was born on July 18, 1997 in my hometown of Borongan,Eastern Samar. Currently i am a third year college student taking up Bachelors of Science in Information Technology(I.T). I'm the type of person that likes to keep himself busy so i try and find any type of hobby out there and see if i'll become passionate about it <br>
			<br>
			My hobbies are currently the following:
				<ul>
					<li>Playing Games (Online/ Offline)</li>
					<li>Playing musical instruments</li>
					<li>Singing</li>
					<li>Editing</li>
					<li>Surfing the internet</li>
					<li>Coding</li>
					<li>Designing</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				 I am a person who strives in trying to become a better version of myself everyday. Because of this i have come to seek different goals in life in which i try to reach everyday. Though i know not all goals can be achieved, i think that just by seeking accomplishment in life you become a better person in the long run and just as i tell myself everyday "you just gotta take the good with the bad". Thanks for visiting and have a good one!
